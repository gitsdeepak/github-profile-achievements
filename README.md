A collection list of all Achievements available on the GitHub profile and how to obtain each one 🏆

Following the launch of the first Mars Helicopter, [Ingenuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)), GitHub [announced](https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/) the new Achievements section:

> We are also using this opportunity to introduce a new Achievements section to the GitHub profile. Right now, Achievements include the Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission badge, the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) badge, and a badge for sponsoring open source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors).

This repository attempts to list them all.

**2022-06-09:** GitHub [announced more Achievements](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/), but without specific criteria. If you see something not listed here or is incorrect, please open an issue :)

## Official list

There ~~is~~ was an official list available in the GitHub Docs at  
<https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile> ([link to the archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20220531023858/https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile)).  
There is still a section which includes specifics on how badges were/are awarded, e.g. which [repositories and versions qualified for the Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement).

~~Consider this repository a mirror, maybe in the future with historic purpose.~~ Unless there will be an official list again, this is it.

From the [start with Ingenuity on 2021-04-19](https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/) until the [additions on 2022-06-09](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/), the first three Achievements had slightly different designs and names. In other words, they were overhauled on 2022-06-09.

```diff
